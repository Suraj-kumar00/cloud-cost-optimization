Cloud cost optimization is essential for managing cloud resources efficiently and avoiding unnecessary expenses. DevOps engineers play a crucial role in identifying stale resources, optimizing infrastructure, and automating cost-saving practices.

## Cloud Cost Optimization in Real-World by Cloud/DevOps Engineer

### Why Organizations Move to the Cloud

Organizations, especially startups and mid-sized companies, adopt cloud computing for the following reasons:

1. **Reduced Infrastructure Overhead** – No need to manage physical servers.

2. **Optimized Costs** – Setting up and maintaining an on-premise data center is expensive. Cloud adoption eliminates:
   - Hardware procurement and maintenance costs.
   - The need for dedicated infrastructure teams.
   - High upfront investments in IT infrastructure.

However, cost savings in the cloud are only effective if resources are managed efficiently.
